## How do we help teams and deliveries to make changes to become more inclusive and for individuals to feel like they can be themselves?

- Explore how we can embed an understanding and attachment to inclusion in Made Tech.
- A leaver has raised lack of diversity on the teams and turned down client teams over being the only non cis white man.
- Some people on their deliveries feel that they're not empowered more externally with clients. Is there a more formal process in place nowadays?
- Some regions are a lot less diverse compared to others. Makes raising inclusion issues harder for people within that region.
  - Could we have something at group to raise it higher.
- Message may not be landing in regards to the D&I service area being the place to raise these issues.
- Internal discrimination should be going to People team as it's a conduct issue that Made Tech would look to address.
- External discrimination should involve the client principle? How do we tackle it with the client?
- We should be ensuring that things like team socials are more inclusive (i.e. not just going for a drink)
