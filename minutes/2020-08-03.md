## Discussion Items

- Not easy to find time to dedicate to working on D&I related things
- Instead of an optional D&I questionnarie, we might be better off having a compulsory census style questionnarie, to help us get a more accurate picture of the company
  - But how do we do this? Still some unknowns
- Feeling less optimistic about progress/impact/change
  - How do we get more consistent engagement?
- If clients are more diverse (e.g. Hackney) can we learn from them?
- Could having things like internal workshops help?
- Could having a more diverse group of people involved the hiring process (interview/pairing sessions) help?
  - But we also don't want to force people from underrepresented groups to do this
