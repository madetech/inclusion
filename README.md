# Diversity and Inclusion at Made Tech

Making Made Tech a better place to work for everyone!

The Diversity and Inclusion Working Group got together to discuss, investigate and hopefully make better the issues Made Tech are facing when it comes to Diversity and Inclusion.

Not that Made Tech isn't a great place to work, but can we make it better, more inclusive and have a diverse set of voices. Especially in the public sector, diversity is vital to produce inclusive and accessible services.

Spiel aside, it feels good, and it's something we all want to see happen!

## Who are we?

Anyone can join the Working Group. There's no initiation ceremony or pledge you need to take, just come along to the meeting and have fun! We're small right now, so it's pretty ad-hoc and disorganised, but as we grow, things will likely become more official, but we don't want to lose the charm of the group!

With that, here's a list of people who are part of the group and any roles they have! Feel free to reach out or on the #supply-inclusion Slack channel if you wanna get involved and add your name here if you're already involved! :)

- Joe Roberts - Leader Advocate Person (totally self-appointed!) They/Them
- Ninamma Rai
- Charlene Hunter
- Chad Tomkiss
- Yasemin Ercan - Head of People @ MT
- Jess Nichols

## What are we doing?

Making Made Tech more diverse, of course!

But you ask, how are you doing that? Well, here's a few things we have outlined, and we'll add more as we come up with them!

- A Diversity Questionnaire to discover what our diversity is and where we should focus - on. We know there's a problem, but we don't precisely know the scale or direction of - the problem!
- Reducing unconscious bias in hiring. This is something we are hoping to implement - soon! We have trialled it in the Made Tech Academy and it has worked pretty well, so - the hope is to bring it into the wider hiring process soon!
- Making it all public! Open source is king, and we wanna espouse that here. This will - hopefully become a resource for people to use and contribute to. :)
- Pay equality and transparency. This is an early days conversation that was floated at our last meeting. Really, we want to be more comfortable with disclosing our pay and making sure that pay is equal at all levels!
